HarperCollins India (3 October 2022),English,500 pages,9356291527,978-9356291522,370 g,20.3 x 25.4 x 4.7 cm,"[""The fourth book of the Ram Chandra series has been a longly awaited book since long, and after it's pre bookings were initiated I decided to have it straightaway. I cannot say that this book is somehow the retelling of Ramayana as it has changed many facts and introduced many new things into the story. Death of the three antagonists has been altered completely which is somehow acceptable but the fact that they were defeated by someone else rather than Shree Ram was somehow heartbreaking. Overall it's a good book although I won't say it had the best story cause of many facts. The ending fascinated me by hinting towards another book in the series which was quite remarkable."", '<b>TL;DR version:</b> This seems be written by some daily soup loving interns. The writing is cheap, full of cliches and too much repetitive. Characters do not have any depth in them. Authors didn\'t bother to pay attention to details at many places.\n\n<b>Longer version:</b>\nI read all the Shiva trilogy books and the first three books in the Ram Chandra Series. I absolutely loved all these 6 books and was a huge fan for the writing style and philosophy of Amish Tripathi.\nAs you can guess, I was eagerly waiting for this book. I bought the book (Kindle edition) as soon as it was released.\nIn the first three books, the story is told in a multi-linear way. The first book was on Ram, the second on Sita and the third one on Raavan. This is also the order in which I liked these three books.\nThe post now contains spoilers. You have been warned, tread carefully.\n\nIt will be best if you read the other three books of the series first if you want to read this one.\n\nAs I started reading the book, it kept disappointing me. The book was relentless in proving that this is one of the worst books I have ever read in my life.\nFollowing were my expectations from the book:\n1. Brilliant war details.\n2. Brilliance of Ram, Raavan, Hanumaan, Angad and Kumbhakaran in the war.\n3. I expected shifting loyalty of Arishtnemi from Vishwamitra to Ram due to his interaction with Ram during the war.\n4. <b>V vs V:</b> More details on the issues between Vishwamitra and Vashishth.\n5. Authors version of Sita\'s agnipariksha\n6. Ram somehow deciding to go to Meluha and giving up Ayodhya due to conflict with Bharat.\n\nObviously the author is not writing the book based on my expectations and so I was ready to be surprised, and yes, I was SURPRISED.\n\nSo what I got from the books are the following:\n1. V vs V story line felt like a joke.\n2. <b>Characters:</b> All the character depth was gone. Everyone was like someone I could not associate with. I felt no feeling for all of them, Ram, Seeta, Raavan, Kumbhakaran, Hanumaan, Bharat, etc.\n3. It was like the last season of Game of Thrones, where the directors thought the audience is due to the special effects, than due to the story.\n4. The useless drama was like daily soup, stupid and useless. Full of cliches, hyper emotions (which you don\'t connect with).\n5. There were so many useless details that bored me to no end. I read them all thinking something useful will come out of it. In end, they were completely useless. Just to give an example, the details of ""Ram setu"" is so useless. It felt as if these details are given to cover up the lack of substance in the story.\n6. The other missing point was that two people can be correct and still oppose each other. For example, the difference of opinion in case of Ram and Bharat. It used to be a feature of Amish\'s book which was completely missing in this one.\n7. There are many departures from Amish\'s style of writing in this book. For example, many useless characters are given names unnecessarily. Some authors do that, some don\'t, but at least they are consistent. It was not clear why the side characters were given names in this book. One of the useless character is named Gajaraj, then Giriraj and back to Gajaraj again.\n8. The sentence formation in this book is absolutely pathetic at places with many sentences consisting of 1-3 words, literally.\n9. Vishwamitra intended Ram to use Daivi Astra again. What happened? Will it happen in the next book?\n10. It felt as if the Mara character will reappear again in this book as it was mentioned in the character details, but no.\n11. The repetition in this book is so irritating. Again, it felt as a sign of over compensation due to the lack of quality.\n12. The war details are pathetic. It is not clear why a brilliant strategist such as Raavan will not have scouts all over his own country. Can you imagine 100s of elephants reached their gates through ocean without Raavan knowing it? This is compounded by the fact that Raavan knew that Ram is coming through ocean route and then through road to their capital city.\n13. If I have to use one word to describe this novel, it will be ""Cheap"". Like a cheap item you purchase which makes you want to kill yourself everyday you use it, this is what the quality of novel felt like. One example from the book ""Deepankar held the bottom of the ladder steady, ensuring that the base didn\'t slip back.""\n14. Good warriors do not show contempt towards others for being less skilled. But surprise, Hanumaan and Kumbhakaran were not so honourable. Hanumaan showed (with disdain) less skilled archers how to shoot. Surprise, surprise, they became expert just by watching Hanumaan once. Why he didn\'t prepare those useless souls before bringing them to such a critical mission?\n15. There is no dearth of useless and irritating details. It was so irritating to know how brilliantly Hanumaan could wistle.\n\nThe last part of the book was a bit better, but that is no reason to read this book. If you are a fan of Amish Tripathi, do not read this book.', ""As the headline says, the book says that Raavan is not so bad.\nNot sure the adaptation will agree with everyone.\nHope this is never adapted to a movie. Especially with Karan Johar.\nWhile Raavan's interpreted character shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's read the first three books, it still takes a while to accept the narrative.\nHaving said that, the book is absolutely brilliant. Finished the 500 odd pages in 2 days.\nI know that Amish means well. The way he portrays his tell allows morons to interpret in their own way. You know who I am talking about considering how the bollywood chose to interpret the Ramayana""]"

It provides a reader with various perspectives, provides handy solutions, charts, and tables to enable the habit forming process. With the book, the author has genuinely tried on providing every possible tool for a reader to sail through smoothly in the process of habit formation and sticking to it.\n\nThe book does its job of making a novice understand the way mind works, comprehending the science of habit formation, and providing the ways to alter the pattern by creating new habits or deleting the existing ones.\n\nIt is packed with the knowledge of psychology, or on the actual wiring of mind. Also, it brings references from the paleolithic age from time to time, and the author has done an exemplary work at making it all interesting, and easy to comprehend via graphs, and effortless writing.\n\nAlso, the author has mentioned numerous examples from day to day life, and from the sports team we follow from, from the last Olympics games and more, to make the subject or the topic more relatable.\n\nWhen writing is concerned, there is a consistency throughout however, there are times when it becomes repetitive and dull. Hence, I have rated it a 4 on 5.', 'The book is undeniably good. Even more so if you download the worksheets at the end. But... The print quality seems dubious at best.']"

In spite of the abuse, Lily‚Äôs mother doesn‚Äôt leave her husband, which leads Lily to believe her mother is weak, and Lily swears never to end up like her.\n\nAs an adult, Lily meets a neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid ‚Äì he is charming, loving and committed. But over time, Lily discovers a side to him that brings her dangerously close to repeating her mother‚Äôs cycle.\n\nAfter reading this book I was confused as to how I felt about it. On one hand, there is a clear depth to it; the book talks about abusive relationships in a raw, vulnerable way that makes you think about the mental and emotional trauma involved, as well as the complexity of such relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, there is also a lot of what I see as juvenile romance ‚Äì irrational, childish expectations from relationships, overflowing emotion, tantrums, rapid switches between extreme highs and lows, and levels of drama that no rational adult would ever subject themselves to.\n\nI also struggled with Ryle‚Äôs character in the early stages of their relationship. In the beginning of the book, he goes to great pains to emphasise how much he hates relationships (which in itself is no sin), and yet the second he meets Lily his entire personality flips and suddenly he is willing to do anything to be with her ‚Äì and once that happens, he is the sickeningly sweet picture of an overly devoted boyfriend who wants to spend every moment complimenting his girlfriend and wanting to have babies. What brought about this drastic change?? Honestly, I found this transformation hard to believe.\n\nAfter reading the book, my aversion to romance novels remains unchanged, but I did find myself feeling much more empathy for victims of domestic abuse ‚Äì the author‚Äôs own experience in an abusive home lends so much more authenticity to the experiences her characters go through ‚Äì I witnessed how our tendency to judge people who go back to their abusers might not always be warranted, for although it seems black and white, the complexity of abusive relationships is not easy to navigate. There are several reasons why one might go back to them without being weak or brainwashed, and I myself have become far more sympathetic to the need to listen and understand before making assumptions and judging someone who is in that same position.', ""The book is really good, actually it's great!

Every time, I pick up a spiritual book or a book by a spiritual personality, it is my basic expectation to learn and know something new which can surprise, shock, astonish and mind-boggle me. If nothing of that sort happens, the book is a failure for me which is written not to introduce new concepts to human beings but just for sake of writing a book to accomplish one of the personal goals and yearly resolutions.\n\nSame has been the case after reading ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs Amazing Secrets‚Äù written by none other than one of the most popular spiritual personality on Youtube- Gaur Gopal Das. I have been following two personalities on Youtube when it comes to spiritual knowledge- No one can beat my following for Sadhguru and 2nd, this gentleman- Gaur Gopal Das. He has such a polite and well-speaking oratory skills that you can hear him for hours. Also, his concepts, examples and logics that he gives in his videos are so up to the mark that it teaches you something new each time you watch one of his new videos. Though I do not like the way ISKCON endorses spiritualism by circulating the knowledge only from the one dimension that they believe in but still, this man speaks individually by not bonding himself under the premise of the institution‚Äôs agenda. Unfortunately, everything that I have spoken about his powerful knowledge sharing capacity in his videos cannot be said for his debut book.\n\nThe book gives me a very basic knowledge of how to lead life which you have yourself kept hearing since childhood from your parents and colony‚Äôs uncles and aunts. Not a single chapter in the book is as impactful as such self-help and spiritual book are expected of. As Das has himself said in the start of the book that writing the book was not his original thought, but the publisher asked him to, this book also displays the same that author just completed it for the sake of at least start with writing books. Author has gone the Robin Sharma way where he has written the book in the conversational format still dividing it into different chapters but couldn‚Äôt deliver the same simple keys that can help us in changing our lifestyle and approach towards living.\n\nThe author has spoken about the four basic wheels of life in the book:- Balancing personal life, maintaining relationships, regulating work life and managing social contributions. The only section that I found little different than what I have regularly read is the one talking about managing work life. Except that, there is a section in which the author has described how should one sit in an asana and release the stress off which also sounded solution-proof. Otherwise, at the end of each chapter, author has summarized the whole chapter, and I am sorry to say, but if you only read those 4-5 bulleted points in the summary, you are done with the book as it has nothing more than that. This is a very confused book where author has also ended up giving examples or real-life scenarios which are not even completely relevant to the stuff he is talking about. Overall, I would say a very disappointing debut and I give this book only 2 stars out of 5.\n\nThanks.\n\nABHILASH RUHELA!!!']"

Collins; 1st edition (15 May 2015),"English, French",144 pages,9351772071,978-9351772071,100 g,20.3 x 25.4 x 4.7 cm,"['This book is written by Jeff Keller who is a motivational speaker, which is evident through the motivational tone of the book. After graduating from law school in 1980, he practiced for a few years. Feeling unhappy with his career in law, he became a motivational speaker which he felt was his true calling. The numerous examples of people who achieved their goals through positive attitude are from his personal experience and research\n\nWhat do I like about this book?\n- The overall motivational tone of the book, that creates a positive drive within yourself\n- To-the-point crisp writing, without being verbose at all (unlike some other books which keep reiterating the same points through multiple pages)\n- Powerful examples from history\n- Great quotes by famous men. It is just a treat to read all these famous words by eminent people.\n- The book justifies its title ‚ÄòAttitude is everything‚Äô through its content.\n\nWhat I did not like about the book?\nWell, honestly, NOTHING. I‚Äôm usually critical of books if I find any flaws with the writing, or content, or engagement, but I didn‚Äôt find anything lacking in this one. Hence, the complete five stars. The book is beautifully written with meaningful content.\n\nThe book begins with a famous quote by Thomas Jefferson ‚Äì ‚ÄúNothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude.‚Äù In the first chapter, Jeff Keller talks about his own circumstances that led to his career change, finally becoming a motivational speaker. He mentions general problems faced by common people in their day to day lives and hence creates a bond with the reader.\n\nThe book is primarily divided into 3 parts and 12 lessons. Each part includes various lessons, which are thought-provoking. The basic message conveyed through these three parts and lessons is ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhen you THINK, SPEAK, and ACT in ways that support your success, you‚Äôre firing on all cylinders and on the way to achieving phenomenal results in your life.‚Äù\n\nPART 1 ‚Äì SUCCESS BEGINS IN THE MIND: THINKING\nIn this part, the author tries to teach us that success begins in the mind, and he focuses on the power of attitude and belief in shaping your destiny.\n\nLesson 1 ‚Äì Your Attitude is your window to the world.\nAttitude is like a mental filter through which you experience the world around you. Some people see the world through a filter of optimism while others have a more pessimist outlook. A person with positive attitude thinks ‚ÄòI CAN‚Äô while the others think ‚ÄòI CAN‚ÄôT‚Äô. We all start off with a clean window when we are young, and as we grow old, life throws some dirt on the window (like criticism, ridicule from peers, rejections, disappointments), and we start doubting our capabilities, we start having negative outlook towards thinks, and we are not as confident as we used to be earlier. The advice given in the lesson is to wash our mental window, so we can control our mental attitude. Every human being has the power to choose his attitude. Every human being has the power to choose his/her reactions to different things happening all around.\nOne of the many Examples cited ‚Äì Dr. Viktor Frankl‚Äôs (Author of Man‚Äôs Search for Meaning ‚Äì would recommend people to read this) experiences during concentration camp.\n\nLesson 2 ‚Äì You are a human magnet.\nThe message of this lesson can be summed up in a single quote by Earl Nightingale ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe become what we think about.‚Äù Jeff states the idea of ‚Äòdominant thought‚Äô. He says, your dominant thoughts rule the day. Your beliefs brought you to where you are today, and your thinking from this point forward will take you where you will be in the future. As human magnets, we have the power to attract success through our thoughts. If you think about positive things, positive outcomes, success ‚Äì same shall follow. However, he rightly warns against the expectation of overnight success too.\n\nLesson 3 ‚Äì Picture your way to success.\nThe author asks the readers to create mental movies in the mind, picturing things and milestones they wished to achieve. At the same time, we have to get rid of our old rubbish mental images, which remind us of failure, negativity, and disappointments.\nOne of the many Examples cited ‚Äì Story of singer Celine Dion where she mentions that from the age of five, she had always imagined singing in front of houseful audience, receiving multiple awards and becoming a superstar. Another example quoted is of Jim Carrey, who wrote a post-dated cheque to himself for $10 Million, which acted as a source of inspiration for him.\n\nLesson 4 - Make A Commitment And You Will Move Mountains.\nJeff mentions the book ‚ÄòThe ultimate secret to getting absolutely everything you want‚Äô by Mike Hemaki. He says, the key to getting what you want is the ‚Äòwillingness to do whatever it takes‚Äô to accomplish your goals. When you commit to something, positive events start happening, the whole universe conspires to make it happen.\nHe gives the example of Benjamin Roll who cleared the bar council exam in his 14th attempt at the age of 74! Another example cited is that of ‚ÄòBaldacci‚Äô who became a writer, by learning the craft of writing, through sheer commitment.\n\nLesson 5 - Turn Your Problems Into Opportunities.\nWhenever something goes wrong, we start questioning ourselves, our circumstances and at times our luck. In such a situation, we have two choices ‚Äì 1. Keep feeling miserable or 2. Learn a lesson from the problem and move on. A problem should be seen as an opportunity to learn, improve, and do something better next time. Adversity encourages us to make necessary changes in our life, tap our hidden potential. It teaches us to be grateful for the small things and helps us build self-esteem and confidence.\nAs Napolean said, ‚ÄúEvery adversity carries with it the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit.‚Äù\n\nPART 2 ‚Äì WATCH YOUR WORDS: SPEAKING\nIn this part, the author focuses on what we speak. What we say, directly shows how we think, and precedes our actions.\n\nLesson 6 ‚Äì Your Worlds Blaze A Trails.\nThe author says that words have immense power. They can build your future, destroy opportunities or help maintain the status quo. Your choice of words defines your personality.\nAlways remember ‚Äì Thoughts > Words > Beliefs > Actions > Results\nThe author cites an inspirational example of Kent Cullers, a scientist at NASA.\n\nLesson 7 ‚Äì How are you?\nJeff says that this question is the most frequently asked questions to any person, and what reply a person gives to this question is extremely important. Now, a reply to this question can be ‚Äì Positive, Mediocre or Negative. We should avoid negative answers as they drain the energy of others as well. Jeff says that we should always reply to this question with words such as ‚ÄòTerrific‚Äô or ‚ÄòGreat‚Äô or other such positive words. This will help boost our confidence and create a positive outlook.\n\nLesson 8 ‚Äì Stop complaining.\nNobody wants to hear about our pains and problems. As William Penn said, ‚Äúthe secret of happiness is to count your blessings while others are adding up their troubles.‚Äù Jeff says that complaining is a major problem in all of us, whereas it doesn‚Äôt help anyone. It doesn‚Äôt help the person ranting about his problems, and definitely doesn‚Äôt help the listener who‚Äôs least interested in listening to someone else‚Äôs problems when he has plenty of his own. However, at the same time, the author clarifies that sharing your problems with your nearest ones, is different from complaining, and rightly so.\n\nPART 3 ‚Äì HEAVEN HELPS THOSE WHO ACT: ACTION\nIn this part, the author emphasizes on the fact that without action, positive thoughts and words will not help you attain the level of success you aimed for.\n\nLesson 9 - Associate with Positive People.\nWe are the average of the people we spend our most time with. The people you hang out with define your outlook and future because they greatly influence our thoughts and life. Hence, it is very important to be in the company of positive people, who have definite goals for themselves. Hanging around folks with no ambition or goals, who imbibe negativity in you, will put you on the path of failure.\n\nLesson 10 - Confront Your Fears and Grow.\nThe path that leads to success is often filled with obstacles. The people who succeed, do so by overcoming these obstacles. If you want to achieve something, you have to get out of your ‚Äòcomfort zone‚Äô. You have to stretch yourself. Adopt a mindset that helps you acquire what you want. Remember, repetition is the key, like any other muscle. It will build up and encourage you to do something great.\n\nLesson 11 ‚Äì Get out there and fail.\nWinston Churchill said, - ‚ÄúSuccess is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.‚Äù In order to success someday, you must be willing to fail today. Successful people around the world are wise enough to know that success doesn‚Äôt come in one shot. You have pe persevere, fail again and again, learn from your failures, and work on it again with double enthusiasm.\nThe author cites an example of TV talk show host ‚ÄòSally Jessy Raphael‚Äô, who was fired 18 times, couldn‚Äôt pay her credit card bills for 26 years, lived on food stamps, before finally making it big in the industry.\n\nLesson 12 - Networking That Gets Results.\nThis lesson shows the importance of teamwork. It shows, if you‚Äôre positive and ready to help people, people, in turn, will go out of their way to help you back. Some key points from this lesson ‚Äì\n- Develop a win-win attitude.\n- Effectively participate in a group or organization.\n- Do not stop the flow of messages, you should keep in touch with your peers.\n- Become a good listener.\n- Congratulate people on for their accomplishment.\n- Make new friends in your field.\n- Do more for others, before expecting something in return.\n\nIn my opinion, this is one of the best self-improvement books ever written. The content of this book far outweighs its price, and although I have provided the summary for a quick glance, you can still go ahead and pick the book for a quick read. There are many more powerful impactful examples cited throughout the book which make this one an interesting read. Recommended!\n\nFavorite Quotes from the book:\n- ‚ÄúEverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms‚Äîto choose one‚Äôs attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one‚Äôs own way‚Ä¶. Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food, and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis, it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not the result of camp influences alone.‚Äù\n- ‚ÄúWhen you believe you can do something, you have the courage to move forward despite being afraid.‚Äù\n- ‚ÄúAs adults, most of us become a lot more concerned about the opinions of others, often hesitating because people may laugh at us or criticize us. At the age of six, we knew we had to fall.‚Äù\n- ‚ÄúWhether you think you can‚Äîor think you can‚Äôt‚Äîyou‚Äôre right!‚Äù ‚Äì Henry Ford\n- ‚ÄúYou see, when you change your attitude, sparks fly in the universe. You‚Äôre energized. You begin to see new possibilities. You move into action. You achieve extraordinary results. That‚Äôs why I say when you change your attitude, you change your life!‚Äù\n- ‚ÄúWhat the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.‚Äù\n- ‚ÄúThey can because they think they can.‚Äù ‚Äì Virgil', ""I finished this book in one day. This is a small and a very interesting book. Small stories with inspiring quotes.

Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, has hired Lowen to complete the remaining books in a successful series his injured wife is unable to finish.\n\nLowen arrives at the Crawford home, ready to sort through years of Verity's notes and outlines, hoping to find enough material to get her started. What Lowen doesn't expect to uncover in the chaotic office is an unfinished autobiography Verity never intended for anyone to read. Page after page of bone-chilling admissions, including Verity's recollection of the night their family was forever altered.\n\nLowen decides to keep the manuscript hidden from Jeremy, knowing its contents would devastate the already grieving father. But as Lowen's feelings for Jeremy begin to intensify, she recognizes all the ways she could benefit if he were to read his wife's words. After all, no matter how devoted Jeremy is to his injured wife, a truth this horrifying would make it impossible for him to continue to love her.\n\nMy Take\n\nVerity is dark, twisted and disturbing, yet a terrific page turner.\nIt's the story of Lowen Ashleigh, a small time author who has run out of money following her mother's cancer treatment. Lowen's literary agent Corey, who was also her ex, brings her an unusual offer - an offer to complete three books in the Virtue series of the best selling author, Verity Crawford.\n\nAs luck would have it, Lowen meets Jeremy Crawford, Verity's husband, by accident, even before she meets him for the publishers meeting. Initially, Lowen has her own doubts, but Jeremy convinces her that she can do it. Lowen is also desperately in need of money, and has been evicted from her rented apart ment. So she gets invited to stay over at the Crawford's house, a big sprawling property overseeing a lake, to go over Verity's office and plan the outlines for the forthcoming novels.\n\nAs Lowen starts living in their house, she learns about the tragedies this family has gone through. They have recently lost their twin girls, and now Verity is indisposed following a car wreck. Crew, their five year old boy, seems to be the only thing that brings life to the house.\n\nWhile going through Verity's work, Lowen finds a secret autobiography written by Verity, and she can't resist the temptation of reading it, convincing herself that she will be better able to understand how Verity's mind works, which will help her complete the remaining novels in the series.\n\nHowever, the autobiography turns out to be a dark, twisted and sordid tale, and Lowen begins questioning everything that is happening around her. At the same time, she begins noticing weird things in the house that Jeremy doesn't seem to notice at all.\n\nThe story flits between Lowen's POV and the chapters between Verity's autobiography. The description keeps us hooked and tense throughout as we keep wondering what exactly happened. The language is lucid and flowing, yet simple. At one point I sort of predicted the end, but I was wrong. So the twist at the end was definitely a surprise for me.\n\nThere are some very sensitive and graphic scenes described, so the reader has to be mentally prepared to read it. And there is lots and lots of sex. Some of which, I felt, was unnecessary, and distracting. Some part seemed a bit stretched, slightly unbelievable, but still it takes the story forward.\n\nBut over all, I loved this edge of the seat gripping tale. It kept me awake till I had read the last word. I rate it 3.5 stars.""]"

His basic thesis is that Hindu culture and philosophical traditions have been maliciously short-charged by US scholars, and this needs to be countered.He famously got into a spat with Wendy Doniger over her interpretation of Hindu mythology. He has built up a large following of acolytes, and of detractors. Therefore, whether you agree or disagree with his views, you can not ignore them.\n\nHe has written several books on this theme, including a book called ‚ÄòBreaking India‚Äô some ten years ago. This book which was not an easy read, primarily because of the rambling nature of the arguments, led to the coining of a somewhat unusual term ‚ÄòBreaking India Forces‚Äô: a miscellaneous grouping of Marxist intellectuals, ‚Äòpseudo-seculars‚Äô, ‚Äòforeign-funded NGOs‚Äô, missionaries, and generally anyone who was disparaging of Hindu culture. The book has had an enormous influence on social media activists and may have contributed to the immense legislative and social pressure that NGOs are facing in India. There is a marked improvement in the flow of Mr Malhotra‚Äôs writing in this second book as compared to the first book ‚ÄòBreaking India 1.0.‚Äô\n\nThe book ratchets up the pressure on civil society further by updating the thesis. The argument now focuses on how Critical Race Theory (CRT) of US has been applied ‚Äòmindlessly‚Äô to Indian situation by the Left, as Critical Caste Theory (CCT). The objective is to keep India down in the same way as the Aryan invasion theory and imported concepts of caste changed India‚Äôs politics for a hundred years. Mr Malhotra is careful to acknowledge the basic logic of CRT in the US situation, while contesting its transformation and application to India as CCT.\n\nMr Malhotra‚Äôs narrative goes on to argue that in order to do so, Harvard University, has deliberately marshalled the wealth and energy of well-known Indian industrialists who are unwittingly giving away their money to Left wing causes (disguised as social justice). The book mentions names of many NGOs, donor agencies as well Universities which are allegedly complicit in this project of the Leftists based in USA. These include Ashoka University, Omidyar Network, J-PAL, Godrej group, Azim Premji group, IPSMF, among several others.\n\nSome of Mr Malhotra‚Äôs arguments make sense from the perspective of practising Hindus (and Christians, Jews, Muslims as well), who perhaps just want to be left alone, and resent the often pointless criticism unleashed by American academia as a kind of intellectual Buzkashi. This sentiment has been expressed rather forcefully in another (deeply disturbing) book titled ‚ÄòInvading the Sacred‚Äô, to which Mr Malhotra also contributed.\n\nOver the years, American academia and publishing industry has developed immense soft power because of their industriousness. You will often see how Indian politicians pathetically crave for recognition by US or Western media, even when they emphatically espouse Swadeshi. So while the influence of anything Amareekan on Indian elite is undeniable, most people are unlikely to buy Rajeev Malhotra‚Äôs thesis of Harvard‚Äôs malicious intrusion, simply because it is so outlandish.\n\nHowever, it is also likely that the conspiracy angle of his arguments will persuade many Indians and will drive the dialogue, at least for some time, on the social media, and possibly in legislative circles. Some of the entities mentioned in the book have already been facing regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThis book is therefore important reading for anyone who wants to understand the perspective of those on the Right, as also get some juicy gossip about the Left. The book is also rather huge, 800 pages, and could be slow reading for many.\n\nIt could also be a disturbing experience, as Mr Malhotra feels that he has has his back to the wall, and passes on that feeling to the reader as well!', ""Excellent authorship and very detailed analysis with humongous volume of background research. In today's world where many academics are floating their theories based on nothing but hearsay (or propaganda), the authors' scientific rigor in writing this book is commendable."", 'The highly researched and brutally candid presentation of vile machinations of the global and local Break-India forces. it will go a long way in educating elite as well as common Indians who love and respect India and Indian culture.']"
